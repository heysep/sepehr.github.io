title: Rails Engineering Coding Bootcamp
---
I have grounded myself in programming and web development basics including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby. In addition, I’ve learned and practiced working with Git, Git Hub, and the CLI. To prepare, I completed courses on Codecademy, Treehouse and Code School. I prefer Code School. They delve much deeper and are generally more advanced to begin with compared to the other two. I also read and worked through Chris Pine’s [Learn to Program book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram).

What I enjoy the most about programming is the opportunity to think. You are given a problem and are left to think about it, break it down, and create a solution. At first, the inexperienced mind can shy away as it feels intimidated. But, if you allow yourself to start where you are, and work your way through, one small step at a time, you soon realize how much you’re capable of.

I think to be great programmer it’s essential at first not to be too impatient to build something epic. But rather, focus on the fundamentals and the blocks of building itself. Once you have gained a good enough understanding of the concepts and have practiced problems then I think the transition to becoming a good builder or software engineer will come more naturally. For me, the end product is not as rewarding as is the process of allowing myself to think.

I’m not a 100% sure what I’ll do after the Iron Yard at this time. I’ll keep myself open to opportunities. But I know I will want to continue learning as there is just so much to learn when it comes to programming and development. I may continue the learning journey by working as a software engineer or, by going to another bootcamp. Regardless, I am really excited and look forward to start learning with The Iron Yard in two weeks.
