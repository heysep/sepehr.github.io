Hi. My name is Sepehr and I'm a software engineer. I learned Ruby on Rails back-end development at the Iron Yard Academy where I built a few small apps along with [the API for abstract](https://github.com/sepehrvakili/abstract-be).

Previously, I helped build an online academy as a product manager in Malaysia. I studied Computer Information Systems and Managerial Sciences at Georgia State University. I have a strong interest in not only software engineering but in the various components involved in bringing a complete quality product to life. 

I pride myself in being reliable, independent, and self-driven while appreciating the fact that it takes teamwork and collaboration to build a complete product. My colleagues would describe me as a strong team player, eager learner, and fast executor.

You can say hi to me [@sepehrvakili](https://twitter.com/sepehrvakili).

Thanks for reading.
