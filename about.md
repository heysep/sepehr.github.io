Hi. My name is Sepehr and I'm currently learning software engineering at [The Iron Yard Academy](http://theironyard.com). Previously, I worked as a product manager building [an online academy](http://mindvalleyacademy.com) in Malaysia. I studied Computer Information Systems and Managerial Sciences at Georgia State University.
