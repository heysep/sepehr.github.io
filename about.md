Hi. My name is Sepehr and I'm a software engineer. I learned Ruby on Rails back-end development at the Iron Yard Academy where I built a few small apps along with [the API for abstract](https://github.com/sepehrvakili/abstract-be). 

Previously, I worked as a product manager building [an online academy](http://mindvalleyacademy.com) in Malaysia. I studied Computer Information Systems and Managerial Sciences at Georgia State University.

I enjoy software engineering for it allows me to contribute to the process of building meaningful quality products that make people's lives better.
