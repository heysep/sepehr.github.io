Hi. My name is Sepehr and I'm a software engineer. I learned Ruby on Rails back-end development at the Iron Yard Academy where I built a few small apps along with [the API for abstract](https://github.com/sepehrvakili/abstract-be).

Previously, I helped build an online academy as a product manager in Malaysia. I studied Computer Information Systems and Managerial Sciences at Georgia State University.

I enjoy software engineering because I love tackling new and challenging problems. 

You can say hi to me [@sepehrvakili](https://twitter.com/sepehrvakili).

Thanks for reading.
