title: About
---

I studied Computer Information Systems and Managerial Sciences at Georgia State University and recently learned Ruby on Rails back-end development at the Iron Yard Academy. While at the Iron Yard, I built standalone applications and APIs including [an API](https://github.com/sepehrvakili/abstract-be) for an online creative space called Abstract for artists to come together and collaborate through the creative process. 

In addition to building web applications, I have a passion for adventure. The last two years I had the opportunity to live and serve as a volunteer in some of the most underprivileged places on Earth such as rural Nepal. Shortly after my volunteer duty, I trekked to basecamp Everest without any guides or assistance. 

In my previous role as a product manager at Mindvalley, I helped build an online academy for human potential development in Malaysia serving thousands of students world-wide. 

I have a strong interest in web development because I enjoy solving new and challenging problems. I pride myself in being reliable, independent, and self-driven while appreciating the fact that it takes teamwork and collaboration to build a complete solution. My colleagues would describe me as a strong team player and an eager learner.
