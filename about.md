title: About
---

I studied Computer Information Systems and Managerial Sciences at Georgia State University and recently learned Ruby on Rails back-end development at the Iron Yard Academy. While at the Iron Yard, I built standalone applications and APIs including [an API](https://github.com/sepehrvakili/abstract-be) for an online space called Abstract for artists to come together and collaborate through the creative process. 

In addition to building web applications, I have a passion for adventure. The last two years I had the opportunity to live and serve as a volunteer in some of the most underprivileged places on Earth such as rural Nepal. Shortly after my volunteer duty, I trekked to basecamp Everest without a guide.

In my previous role as a product manager at Mindvalley, I helped build an online academy for personal development in Malaysia serving thousands of students world-wide. I have a strong interest in software development as it allows me to be a part of solving today's most challenging problems.
